## Pedigrad

The whole library is being reorganized to translate the new content of [Category theory for genetics II: genotype, phenotype and haplotype](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.07004). Current code should work. Tutorial and documentation will be added.


> [!NOTE]
> Most of the stuff has been written already, so this should come soon, but I want to add clean content for proper use of the library.
